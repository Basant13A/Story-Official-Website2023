           Her Choice is What Decides Her Story 
         </h2> 
         <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;After being pushed to her death by a mysterious figure, Park Eun-ha reincarnates in the 
            world of a novel as Raeliana McMillan, a side character destined to be poisoned by her fiancé. 
            To change her story she needs a plan... 6 months pretending to be the fake fiancée of the 
            novel's male protagonist, Duke Noah Wynknight. But will partnering with this cold-hearted,
            angel-faced demon of a man really help her avoid another ill-fated ending or is there more to uncover?!

            <h4>This is definitely one story I would reread over and over again!</h4>
             <p>One of the first reincarnation isekai manhwas I have read and it never gets boring! 
              Even until the latest chapter, the suspense is still going strong to solve the mystery behind 
              Raeliana’s reincarnation. I also really love both Raeliana and Noah. They have very good chemistry
              and the both of them are a power couple! They are just perfect for each other! The romance for this
              one is a slow burn. Started off from contracted lovers to real lovers.

             <p> " Masterfully created, the art and plot work in perfect tandem to bring us a story that shows how two 
              people should fall in love. The author doesn't hesitate to include elements that further shape the world 
              the characters live in - interesting creatures, engaging characters, hidden agendas and political turmoil.
               All so wonderfully done that you'd feel a mix of bittersweet joy when you reach the last chapter. "

            <p>" I binge-watched the first few episodes and they were splendid and I had to actually find the original manga 
              to quench my curiosity. The concept of this anime was very unique and I really enjoyed how well each character 
              has been given story-development but most importantly the main characters share a fantastic chemistry and the
               anime does not specifically focus on just one of them primarily which is the best catch."

            me to get sucked in, but goodness, once I was, that was it! I could NOT stop reading!! Once I started, I 
            could not finish until the end, and GAH! Why must I have to wait for the next volume?! This series will definitely

          the characters they were so fun to read about and the chemistry between the leads was top notch. Then, I found myself 
          getting the novel to read more about the details. It was such a wonderful experience for me. The way the author
          narrates the story along with the build up and easter eggs is so amazing! I am so glad I got to get the merch since this
